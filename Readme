Provides custom REST API endpoints for the Newsroom mobile application, including authentication, content retrieval, and user personalization.

== Description ==

Newsroom API is a comprehensive WordPress plugin designed to power the backend of the Newsroom mobile application. It extends the WordPress REST API with custom endpoints for user authentication (JWT-based), content management, and personalized user experiences.

**Key Features:**

*   **JWT Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and social login (Google, Facebook, Apple).
*   **Custom Content Endpoints:** Optimized endpoints for fetching posts, categories, regions, and videos.
*   **User Personalization:** Features for saving posts, following categories/regions, and tracking "continue reading" progress.
*   **Interaction:** Feedback submission and ad placement management.
*   **Custom Taxonomy:** Registers a 'region' taxonomy for localized content.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/newsroom-api` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3.  **Important:** Ensure the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is defined in your `wp-config.php` file for security. If not defined, the plugin uses a default fallback (not recommended for production).
    `define('JWT_SECRET_KEY', 'your-secret-key-here');`
4.  Flush rewrite rules by visiting Settings > Permalinks and clicking "Save Changes".

== API Endpoints ==

All endpoints are prefixed with `wp-json/`.
