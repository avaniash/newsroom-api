Tracks changes to ACF fields and allows rollback to previous versions.

== Description ==

ACF History and Rollback is a lightweight plugin that tracks changes made to Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) values on Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types.

*   **History Log:** View a detailed history of changes (Date, User, Old Value, New Value) in a metabox on the edit screen.
*   **One-Click Rollback:** Revert any field to a previous value with a single click.
*   **Diff Comparison:** (Planned) Visual diff of text changes.

2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3.  Edit any post with ACF fields to see the "ACF Field History" metabox.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the history stored? =
The plugin creates a custom database table `wp_acf_history` to store the logs efficiently, keeping your `wp_postmeta` table clean.
